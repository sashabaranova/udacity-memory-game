Card matching game created for Udacity FEND project

## Description
Simple card matching game for all devices with beloved GOT characters.
16 cards, 8 types - match them all!

In one move the player can click 2 cards. 
If they match, they remain open, if they don't, they are closed.

Timer starts as the player clicks the very first card.

The player also gets a star rating as follows:

When all cards are matched, a win board with the game score pops up.
